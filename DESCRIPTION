Title: Make Sense to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Outputs
Version: 0.99.15

Description: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a very powerful and 
  interesting computation method that allows and easy correlation between 
  differential expressed genes to biological processes.Unfortunately, although 
  it was designed to help researchers to interpret gene expression data it can 
  generate huge amounts of results whose biological meaning can be in turn 
  difficult to interpret. 
  Many available tools rely on hierarchically structured Gene Ontology (GO) 
  classification to reduce reundandcy in the results. However, due to the 
  popularity of GSEA many more gene set collections, such as those in the 
  Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), are emerging. Since these collections 
  are not organized as those in GO, their usage for GSEA do not always give a 
  straightforward answer or, in other words, the results can be challenging to 
  interpret with the currently available tools. For these reasons, GSEAmining 
  was born to be an easy tool to create reproducible reports to help researchers
  make biological sense of GSEA outputs.
