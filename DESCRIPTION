Title: Make Sense to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Outputs
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Oriol Arqués
Maintainer: Oriol Arqués <oriol.arques@gmail.com>
Description: Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA), although designed to help
  researchers to interpret gene expression data, can be difficult to interpret.
  Many available tools rely on Gene Ontology (GO) classification to reduce
  reundandcy in the results. However, due to the popularity of GSEA, many more
  gene set collections, such as those in the Molecular Signatures Database 
  (MSigDB), are emerging. Unfortunately, analysis of such collections are not
  always straightforward or can be more challenging using currently available 
  tools. GSEAmining wants to provide an easy tool to produce reproducible 
  reports from the output files of GSEA and leading edge analysis.
