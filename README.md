Make biological sense of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis outputs

Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA), although designed to help
  researchers to interpret gene expression data, can be difficult to interpret.
  Many available tools rely on Gene Ontology (GO) classification to reduce
  reundandcy in the results. However, due to the popularity of GSEA, many more
  gene set collections, such as those in the Molecular Signatures Database 
  (MSigDB), are emerging. Unfortunately, analysis of such collections are not
  always straightforward or can be more challenging using currently available 
  tools. GSEAmining is born to be an easy tool to produce reproducible 
  reports from the output files of GSEA and leading edge analysis.
